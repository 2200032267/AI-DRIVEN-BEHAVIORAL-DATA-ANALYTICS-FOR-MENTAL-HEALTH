## üìú Abstract  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming mental healthcare through early diagnosis, personalized therapy, and ongoing monitoring. This project presents a multimodal AI platform using Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, facial expression analysis, and psychological testing to quantify mental health interactively. Audio and video inputs are analyzed via deep learning to detect emotional tone, cognitive styles, and non-verbal behaviors. The architecture dynamically generates psychological tests enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Multimodal data fusion improves prediction validity, and reinforcement learning enables adaptive therapy recommendations. The system is GDPR and ISO 13120 compliant to ensure privacy and ethical use. Future enhancements include federated learning and wearable device integration for prolonged monitoring. This study demonstrates AI's potential for scalable, personalized, and privacy-aware mental health therapies.

## 1. Introduction  
Mental health disorders affect millions globally, often undiagnosed due to limited clinical resources and subjective assessments. AI offers scalable diagnostic tools by analyzing diverse data sources to detect behavioral and emotional patterns. Methods like NLP, speech and facial emotion detection, and interactive testing can improve early diagnosis and therapy. This project introduces a multimodal AI framework that enhances mental health assessments through intelligent behavioral analytics.
